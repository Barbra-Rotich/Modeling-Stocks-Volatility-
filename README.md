# Modelling Stocks Volatility 

Hello ðŸ‘‹, welcome to this repo!âœ¨ 

In this project, I got data from the AlphaVantage API, stored it in aN SQL database, built and trained a GARCH model to predict volatility, and created my own API to serve predictions from my model.  



Technical skills covered include data engineering, data science, and model deployment
